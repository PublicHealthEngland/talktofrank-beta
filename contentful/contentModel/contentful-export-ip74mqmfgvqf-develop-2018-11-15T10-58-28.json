Heavy users can lose this cartilage and end up with one large nostril and a misshapen nose.\n \n- Taking cocaine when pregnant can damage your baby, cause miscarriage, premature labour and low birth weight.\n \n- Regularly smoking crack can cause breathing problems and pains in the chest.\n \n- Injecting cocaine can damage veins and cause ulcers and gangrene. Sharing needles or other injecting equipment can spread HIV and hepatitis infections too. It's also easier to overdose from injecting cocaine.\n \n- Speedballing (injecting a mixture of cocaine and heroin) can have fatal results.

It can look like dried herbs and is usually brownish-green in colour.\n\n#### Skunk\nThis is the name given for particular strains of grass that are very strong. Skunk’s become very popular in recent years and is often bright, pale or dark green in colour and covered in tiny crystals. \n\n#### Hash/hashish \nNot nearly as common as it used to be, hash (or hashish) is made from the resin of the cannabis plant and is black or brown in colour, soft or hard – depending on the type. \n\n#### Cannabis oil \nThis is a dark, sticky and honey-coloured substance that’s much less common than other types. \n\nHighly concentrated forms of cannabis extracted using butane also exist. These come in a solid form known as “dab” or “shatter” and may also be used as an e-liquid in vape pens.\n\n"

          "en-US": "### Smoke spliffs\nIn the UK, most people mix it with tobacco and roll it into a cannabis cigarette known as a spliff or joint. Some people don’t use tobacco at all and make weed-only spliffs.\n\n### Smoke bongs\nUsers do this mix by mixing the drug with tobacco and putting it in a pipe, lighting it, and then inhaling the smoke through water out of a large tube. There are many types of bongs, and not everyone uses tobacco. \n\n### Eat and drink it (edibles)\nPeople do this by mixing it into cakes (hash brownies), tea and even yoghurt. The effects can take longer to kick in if you take it this way and last longer.  You might also accidentally end up taking a larger dose than you wanted to.\n\n### Vape it\nThis method has become more popular in recent years. Most people use a vapouriser which heats the cannabis, rather than burning it. Very little is known about the health impact of vaping cannabis. \n\n### Is there a safer way to take cannabis? \nThe general advice is to only use when you’re feeling happy and relaxed, in a safe environment, and with people you’re comfortable with. \n\nStronger  forms and strains of cannabis are more likely to cause paranoia and mental health issues. Try to avoid these if you can, and take cannabis that’s lower in THC and which  contains CBD instead.\n\nSmoking cannabis with tobacco increases the risk of becoming dependent on nicotine. To avoid this, don’t use tobacco in bongs and spliffs. \n"

        "effectsFeeling": {
          "en-US": "Cannabis is classed as a hallucinogenic and sedative drug. It can make people feel more aware of their senses and more relaxed (stoned), and its hallucinogenic effects can give you the feeling that time is slowing down.\n\nIt can also make you very hungry, known as ‘the munchies’, or make you feel very sick – known as ‘a whitey’.\n\n#### THC & CBD \nThe hallucinogenic effects of cannabis are mainly due to a compound in cannabis called THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). \n\nThe other important compound in cannabis is CBD (cannabidiol). Skunk and other strong forms of cannabis have high levels of THC in them and very little or no CBD. \n\nIt's thought that CBD can balance out some of the effects of THC and make users less likely to feel anxious and paranoid. You can’t tell from looking or smelling the cannabis whether there is a balance of CBD and THC in it, but in general, hash may have more CBD than skunk. \n\nPeople who take cannabis say they feel: \n\n- relaxed\n- paranoid\n- chilled out\n- confused \n- happy \n- sick \n- giggly\n- anxious\n- hungry \n- light-headed \n- faint \n\nIts effects vary massively depending on:\n\n- the kind of person you are\n- what you take (some types of cannabis are stronger than others) \n- the environment you’re in\n- how much you take \n- how often you take it\n"

This is because studies suggest that cannabis effects the part of the brain we use for learning and remembering things.\n \n- Perform badly in exams. Because cannabis impacts the part of the brain we use for learning and remembering things, regular use by young people (whose brains are still developing) has been linked to poor exam results.\n\n"

Don’t scare them or chase after them.\n- Try to find out what they’ve taken\n- Stay with them\n \n\nIf they are anxious, tense or panicky you should:\n\n- Sit  them in a quiet and calm room.\n- Keep them away from crowds, bright lights and loud noises.\n- Tell them to take slow deep breaths.\n- Stay with them.\n \n\nIf they are really drowsy you should:\n\n- Sit them in a quiet place and keep them awake,\n- If they don’t respond or become unconscious call an ambulance immediately and place them in the recovery position.\n- Don’t scare them, shout at them or shock them,\n- Don’t give them coffee to wake them up,\n- Don’t put them in a cold bath to “wake them up” – this wastes time and there’s a risk of drowning,\n \n\nIf they are unconscious or having difficulty breathing you should:\n\n- Immediately phone for an ambulance,\n- Place them into the recovery position,\n- Stay with them until the ambulance arrives,\n- If you know what drug they’ve taken tell the ambulance crew, this can help make sure that your friend gets the right treatment straight away."

However, PMA is more poisonous and can kill at lower doses than MDMA. Also like MDMA, it can cause a fatal rise in body temperature.\n\nPMA has been found in ecstasy pills and these come in a variety of colours and shapes. "

People can get so out of control that they don't realise they're in danger of overheating and  dehydration. Users should take regular breaks from dancing and other activity to cool down, and should keep hydrated. If you feel your temperature soaring on the dance floor seek help immediately.\n\n- As little as a quarter of a tablet (60mg) is enough to significantly increase blood pressure, body temperature and pulse rates.\n\n- Anyone with a heart condition, blood pressure problems, epilepsy or asthma can have a very dangerous reaction to the drug.\n\n- Anyone using too much can get paranoid and depressed.\n \n- PMA can cause muscle spasms and lots of people feel very sick after taking it.\n\n- Be careful not to overdo it when drinking fluid to avoid dehydration and overheating as drinking too much water can also be dangerous or even fatal. Just remember to sip no more than a pint of non-alcoholic fluid every hour. This is important because drugs like PMA and MDMA (ecstasy) can cause the body to release a hormone which suppresses the production of urine. So, if a user drinks a few pints of liquid too quickly, water builds up in the body and interferes with the body’s salt balance. This excess of water in the body can directly  harm brain function; and this can be as deadly as not drinking enough water.\n\n- The long term risks associated with PMA have yet to be studied but many are likely to be similar to ecstasy.\n"

People who are dealing with addiction usually:\n\nFeel the need for the drug regularly. \nHave a constant supply of it.\nHave failed to stop using.\nWill do things they normally wouldn't do (such as stealing).\nSometimes people who have a problem don’t think they have or refuse to believe that they are addicted or dependent. So if you think your friend has a problem and you want to help them, think about how you're going to approach it and what you’re going to say.  It could be a sensitive subject for them and you don’t what to looking like you’re nagging them. They may not listen to you at first but don’t let this put you off.  The best thing that you can do is to be there for them, to support and encourage them to change.\n\nA good thing to do is keep your friend away from situations or places which might entice them - like say the pub or a mate's house. Rather, show them some other things to do to keep themselves busy.\n\nWith the proper help and support, many drug users are able to overcome their drug use before any serious harm has been done to them, or their family and friends.  Other drug users have to hit rock bottom before they can see the harm and damage they are doing and start addressing their drug use.\n\nThere are a number of ways to get the information you need to help your friend. You may want to know more about the drug by exploring our A-Z of drugs, read about treatment or to find out what services are available to you locally. And of course, you or your friend can call FRANK anytime on 0300 123 6600 for confidential advice."

The tobacco is burnt and the smoke is sucked through the water pipe, which cools the smoke down allowing it to be breathed in by the smoker. However, smoking Shisha for one hour can deliver the same health risks as smoking 100 cigarettes.\n\nShisha is a part of Middle Eastern and Indian culture, but it seems to be becoming increasingly popular in the UK among non-Middle Eastern and Indian groups.\n\nThe financial cost of being a smoker depends on the scale of their habit, but as a rough guide, smoking 20 a day for one year will cost over £2,700.\n"

Using poppers with alcohol can increase this risk.\n- If you use poppers while you’re having sex, be aware that you may feel less inhibited and take risks - such as not using a condom.

Some opiates at low doses, such as codeine, when combined with other analgesics like paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin are designed to be able to be bought over-the-counter in pharmacies.

          "en-US": "An opiate painkiller that has been properly prescribed or has been obtained from your local pharmacy is subject to stringent controls, as with any other medicine, so you can be sure of its strength and that it has not been tampered with. But you can't be sure about this with opiate painkillers that have been obtained from unreliable or illegal sources. The risks associated with taking an opiate painkiller, especially in high dose, purchased from a source outside the legitimate supply chain (for example, a website – particularly if hosted overseas) may include:\n\n- Constipation\n- Itching\n- Nausea and retching\n- Lethargy\n- Dizziness or fainting\n- In overdose, suppression of normal breathing, and risk of respiratory arrest (when you stop breathing altogether).\n- Certain opiate painkillers have additional specific non-opioid effects, which may be described by the prescriber, and will be described in the patient information leaflet.\n- Overuse of codeine when it is taken already combined with one of the simple analgesic drugs, can lead to paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen poisoning and even death. Whilst paracetamol, ibuprofen and aspirin may seem harmless in normal doses, they can cause really serious problems in high doses - with risks of kidney failure, liver failure, and of severe damage to, or bleeding from, the stomach, which can be fatal.\n- There is a greater risk of overdose and death if you are mixing opiate painkillers with other drugs that suppress breathing such as alcohol, benzodiazepines (like diazepam or Valium), and/or other opiate drugs. There's a particular risk of death due to inhaling vomit – because opiate painkillers can sedate you, can add to the risk of vomiting, and can stop you from coughing properly. The vomit blocks the airways or later leads to pneumonia.\n- In pregnancy, regularly having taken high doses of opiate painkillers for a continuous sustained period of time in the lead up to delivery can lead to withdrawal symptoms for the newborn baby.\n- For pregnant women who have been using substantial amounts of opiates daily for a period of time, it's not a good idea to stop using them suddenly without proper advice. This is because this might increase their risk of having a miscarriage or having a premature labour. Women in such circumstances should seek medical advice before stopping.\n- Injecting any opiate painkiller can do nasty damage to your veins and arteries, and this can lead to gangrene (death of body tissue, usually a finger, toe or a limb), blood clots/thromboses and to infections.\n- There are also risks from sharing needles, syringes and other equipment used for injecting – with the danger of developing serious tissue infections or sharing viral infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV."

If opiate painkillers are taken primarily to get high or to manage psychological pain, the risk of becoming dependent on the drugs is greater.\n\nTolerance can also build, so that users have to take more just to get the same effects or to avoid unpleasant withdrawals. This is one of the reasons opiates can become ineffective for long-term chronic pain.\n\nPhysical dependence is common in regular users. The withdrawal symptoms include tremors, anxiety, yawning, sweating, runny nose, sleep disturbance, nausea, goose-bumps, restlessness, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and muscle spasms."

Some users have said that they feel ‘enlightened’ when taking MXE. Others have reported being agitated.\n\n- MXE can produce a feeling of ‘floating away’, as if the mind and body are separated (called a ‘dissociative state’).

So you could end up hurting yourself or being hurt by others.\n \n- Because of its strength, it’s reportedly easier to take too much and overdose on MXE. Compared to many other powder drugs, you only need to take a small amount of MXE to have a substantial effect.\n \n- MXE is marketed as a replacement for ketamine, but without ketamine’s harmful effect on the bladder. However, there is no evidence to support this. It is possible that MXE will turn out to be as toxic as ketamine in this regard.\n- \n- It appears that MXE can make the heart beat faster than it should (called tachycardia) and increases blood pressure. Both of which might lead to a range of problems including heart attacks or strokes.\n \n- MXE can also cause involuntary eye movement, loss of balance and poor coordination, unsteadiness on your feet and slurred speech.

Even testing kits may not find everything. \n\nYou may be at risk from other drugs and ingredients added to the pill or powder, as well as to the ecstasy itself.\n\nEcstasy pills are sometimes cut with amphetamines (like speed), caffeine and other substances that have some similar effects but are cheaper to produce. Some pills are cut with stimulants that are slower to kick in than MDMA, and so users have taken more of the pill (or pills) and then overdosed. Always start by taking a half or a quarter of a pill first - you may find that is enough. \n \nMDMA powder can also be cut with other ingredients. You should always start by taking a very small amount to begin with and waiting for the effects to kick in before deciding whether to take anymore."

          "en-US": "You may have seen ‘Benzo Fury’ in the news this week but what is it and what effect can it have on you?\n\n‘Benzo Fury’ is the brand name of a ‘legal high’ which commonly contains the chemical 6-APB.\n\n6-APB is a mild stimulant and may act like amphetamines (such as speed) and like ecstasy. It can make you feel full of energy and experience colours and sounds more intensely.\n\nOn the flip side it can cause panic attacks and leave people feeling confused.\n\nAs with all ‘legal highs’ you can never be 100% sure that any ‘legal high’, no matter where you buy it from, is safe or is what it claims to be.  6-APB is often sold as ‘Benzo Fury’ which has been found to contain other ‘legal highs’ like 5-(2-aminopropyk) benzofuran and the now illegal Class B drug, D2PM.\n\nFind out more about [6-APB](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/6-apb\\\").\n\nLast updated: 13th June 2012"

We know that using alprazolam has caused some young people to end up in hospital, particularly when they have mixed it with alcohol.\n\nAlprazolam is an anti-anxiety medicine in the [benzodiazepine family](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/tranquillisers\\\") and is similar to diazepam (Valium) but it’s about 20 times stronger and has a quicker, shorter-acting effect. If you take alprazolam you might very quickly feel relaxed, tired and sleepy.\n\nBut you are also at risk of serious harm if you take alprazolam. Like other benzos, long-term use could mean you become physically dependent on it and then suffer withdrawal symptoms if you stop using it. Alprazolam can also cause blackouts and put you at greater risk of being taken advantage of sexually. If you mix it with alcohol you’re at a big risk of overdose caused by heart and breathing problems – and this can lead to death.\n\nIf you or someone you know gets into trouble with alprazolam, you will need to act quickly.

There is no way to know which and how much of these drugs you are getting and how dangerous it could be.  \n  \nYou’ll find more information on Spice from the links or you can **talk to FRANK on 0300 123 6600** in complete confidence.  \n  \n**How do I know what I’m taking?**  \nThe simple answer is that you don’t. In fact, you can never be sure that any powder, pill or liquid contains what you’re told it does.  \n  \nYou can also not be sure how you might react to particular drugs. Everyone is different.  \n  \n**What do I do if I feel unwell?**  \nIf you’ve taken something and you find you start to feel unwell, take time out to look after yourself and ask for help if you need it. If the problem doesn't improve or is getting worse, you should seek medical help."

          "en-US": "Christmas is just around the corner, which means party season is about to kick off, but what’s the deal with all the drinking?  \nThere’s lots of information about alcohol out there which can get confusing. FRANK sets the record straight by busting some of the most common booze myths.  \n  \n**Myth:** Drinking makes you more confident and fun  \n**Busted:** Drinking can make you dance like your dad  \nLots of people think that drinking looks fun and will make them feel confident. But there are two sides to it – drinking isn’t all laughs. Although we don’t always talk about it much, drinking can cause all kinds of problems. Although drinking alcohol can make you feel more confident, it can also make you do things you wish you hadn't - things that can get caught on camera.  \n  \n**Myth:** Don’t eat carbs after 8pm  \n**Busted:** Eat!  \nDon't drink on an empty stomach. Before you go out, have a meal that includes carbohydrates (such as pasta or rice) or fats. The food will help slow down the body’s absorption of alcohol.  \n  \n**Myth:** A drink in the morning will cure a hangover  \n**Busted:** Avoid the hairy dog!  \nHangover cures like the ‘hair of the dog’ (drinking more alcohol in the morning) are generally a myth. There are no cures for a hangover. There are only tips for avoiding hangovers and for easing the symptoms if you have one. If you have a big night out, try to drink a glass of water between alcoholic drinks during the night and take a glass of water with you to bed and sip it through the night.  \n  \n**Myth:** My friends won’t like me if I don’t drink with them  \n**Busted:** Friends respect your honesty  \nIt is ok not to drink and you should never feel pressurised into doing something you don't want to do. Remember your friends will respect you more for saying how you feel about drinking. Talking to your friends about the reasons you don't want to drink can help the situation and you may not be the only one who feels this way. Try arranging to meet them to do other things that don’t involve drinking.  \n  \n**Myth:** Everyone Drinks  \n**Busted:** No they don’t!  \nLess young people drink alcohol than you would think and remember, it is against the law for anyone under 18 to buy alcohol in a pub, off-licence, supermarket or on-line.  \n  \n  \n**Remember you can talk to FRANK for free and in confidence 24 hours a day on 0300 123 6600**.   \n  \nPublished: 15th December 2014"

          "en-US": "There have been a number of cases in Ipswich recently where people have died after taken what they thought was [ecstasy](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/ecstasy#aka=MDMA\\\"), but appears actually to be [PMMA](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/pma#aka=PMMA\\\").  \n  \nConfusingly, as [PMMA](\\\"www.talktofrank.com/drug/pma#aka=PMMA\\\") is often sold as [ecstasy](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/ecstasy#aka=MDMA\\\") some of the street names for the two drugs are also the same. Sometimes PMMA-containing pills even look like regular ecstasy pills; and one powder often looks like another.  \n  \n**What is PMMA?**\n\nPMMA is similar to MDMA (the chemical normally used in ecstasy). It is also similar to [PMA](\\\"www.talktofrank.com/drug/pma\\\"). It can make you feel alert, alive and full of energy. However, PMMA is more poisonous at lower doses than MDMA and too much can cause a fatal rise in body temperature.  \n  \nThe effects of PMMA also take longer than [MDMA](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/ecstasy#aka=MDMA\\\") to begin to be felt – so it’s not unusual for some users to think that the first pill was a dud and hasn’t worked and to take an additional pill (or pills) and accidently overdose, which can be fatal.  \n  \nYou’ll find more information on [PMMA](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/pma#aka=PMMA\\\") from the links or you can **talk to FRANK on 0300 123 6600 in complete confidence**.  \n  \n**How do I know what I’m taking?**  \nThe simple answer is that you don’t. The pills that were taken in Ipswich were shaped like the Superman logo and looked like a typical ecstasy pill.  In fact, you can never be sure that any powder, pill or liquid contains what you’re told it does.  \n  \nYou can also not be sure how you might react to particular drugs. Everyone is different.  \n  \n**What do I do if I feel unwell?**  \nIf you’ve taken something and you find you start to feel unwell, take time out to look after yourself and ask for help if you need it. If the problem doesn't improve or is getting worse, you should seek medical help. You won’t be reported to the police."

Heroin is a class A drug, so it’s illegal to have for yourself, give away or sell. ‘Street’ heroin sold as 'brown' is sometimes now used by clubbers as a chill out drug after a big night out. It is still just the same street heroin but some people mistakenly think it's not as addictive.  \n  \nIt’s common for heroin to be mixed with a variety of substances, such as sugar, starch, powdered milk, quinine or paracetamol – this increases its weight and the drug dealer’s profits. Take a closer look [](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/under-the-microscope\\\") [under the microscope](\\\"/under-the-microscope\\\") to find out more about heroin purity.  \n  \n**Here are some of the main effects and risks of heroin:**\n\n*   A small dose of heroin gives the user a feeling of warmth and well-being, bigger doses can make you sleepy and very relaxed.\n*   The first dose of heroin can bring about dizziness and vomiting.\n*   Heroin is highly addictive and people can quickly get hooked.\n*   Injecting heroin and sharing injecting equipment can be very risky, as it runs the risk of the injector catching or spreading a virus, such as HIV or hepatitis C. There is also the risk that veins may be damaged and that an abscess or blood clot may develop. \n\n  \n  \n**In case of emergency**  \n  \nIf someone collapses call an ambulance immediately, turn them onto their side to avoid choking and stay with them until the ambulance arrives. Remember, you won't get into trouble with the authorities for having taken drugs – paramedics don't call the police unless there has been a fatality.  \n  \n_Published 24th July 2014 _"

Maybe offer to cook up a big batch of pasta for your new housemates and get to know each other.  \n  \n**2.Be yourself.** Changing your opinions or what you wear to fit in with people is exhausting. Don’t be a copy-cat, be yourself and you’ll find friends who respect you for who you are  \n  \n**3.Stick to your guns.** Don’t feel under pressure to take drugs if you don’t want to. Say ‘No’ firmly but clearly and without making a big deal about it. True friends will accept who you are whatever your response.  \n  \n**4.Student Discount!** You might feel like Jordan Belfort when you open your banking app and realise you've just been granted the first instalment of your student loan, but it will quickly deteriorate as you go out enjoying yourself. Remember, the majority of high-street chains offer discounts if you flash your student car (just remember to smile in the photo!)  \n  \n**5.Leave the mixing to the DJ’s.** Be careful about mixing any drugs, including alcohol as this can substantially increase risk of side-effects. If you do take drugs, try to make sure you are with friends and tell them exactly what you have taken in case you run into difficulties, including whether you are mixing your drugs.  \n  \n**6.Legal doesn’t mean Safe.** Be wary of so-called ‘legal highs’, just because a substance is legal, it doesn’t mean it is safe. Legal highs contain a range of potentially dangerous chemicals and their makeup changes all the time - so you can never be certain what you have bought, and what the effects might be.  \n  \n**7.First impressions count.** Drinking too much can impair your judgement and leave you feeling like you can dance like Diversity (when it actually looks like your dad). Try to have a glass of water between alcoholic drinks.  \n  \n**8.Pace yourself.** You have years at uni to enjoy the nightlife, don’t burnout too early. Enjoy a night in watching trash TV without your parents around to tell you off.    \n  \n**9\\. Hide an emergency tenner**. Make sure you know how you’re getting home after a night out – check out the university night buses on offer, or save the all-important “emergency tenner” to pay for a taxi should you need it.    \n  \n**10\\.

You may have heard people chatting at school or watched scenes in your favourite soap. There is lots of information about [alcohol](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/alcohol\\\") out there which can get confusing. FRANK takes a moment to answer some of the big questions about booze.\n\n**Is there a safe amount of alcohol that you can drink?    **  \nFor young people – it is recommended that you don’t drink at all if you are under 15, as this can be especially harmful. At age 16 you can drink wine, beer or cider with a meal in a restaurant and the legal age that you can buy alcohol is 18.

When some of the tablets were tested they contained 'para-methyl derivative of 4-methylaminorex'. It’s a bit of a tongue-twister but essentially this substance is thought to be a stimulant, like [speed](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/speed\\\"). Stimulants put pressure on the heart and can affect your mind.\n\nA similar drug was withdrawn because of worries that its use led to life-threatening changes on blood pressure.\n\n**What’s in a name?**  \n'Para-methyl derivative of 4-methylaminorex' is not really a catchy name so the drug is more likely to be sold under other names. It might be called ‘Speckled Red’ or ‘Brown Cherries’ but these names are just made-up by people who sell drugs. Sometimes, 'para-methyl derivative of 4-methylaminorex' may be found in tablets known by a different brand name.\n\nThe names ‘Speckled Red’ and ‘Brown Cherries' seem to have been used because at least some of those particular tablets were red/brown or red/grey in colour and had a cherry logo stamped on them.

FRANK answers some of the most common questions we’re asked about cannabis.\n\n**1) ****Is cannabis safe because it’s natural?**  \nA big myth about cannabis is that because it is natural it is safe for you to use. Whilst it can make you feel relaxed it can seriously affect your mental health. It can lead to isolation and a lack of motivation, which can result in you not taking part in your hobbies and interests. It can also affect your school work which may lead to poor exam results.\n\n**2) ****How many people smoke cannabis?**  \nNot as many as you think! In 2012, 89% of 11-15 year olds had _never_ tried cannabis.\n\n**3) ****Is cannabis good for you?**  \nCannabis or weed can make you feel relaxed and happy but it also has some serious side effects. It can make you feel very anxious and even paranoid. Using it has also been linked, in some people, to serious, long-term mental health problems. Visit the A-Z for more information about the [effects of cannabis](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cannabis\\\").\n\n**4) Is smoking tobacco better than cannabis?**  \nSmoking anything can cause damage to your lungs whether it’s one joint a week or 10 [cigarettes](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/tobacco\\\") a day. Whilst cannabis can make you feel relaxed and happy it also has some serious side effects. It can make you feel very anxious and even paranoid. It can effect your concentration and this can affect how well you do at school.\n\n**5) ****How can I help my friend/relative deal with their cannabis use?**  \nYou can talk to them and explain why you are worried about their [cannabis](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cannabis\\\") use and how it makes you feel. You can point out that there are [local services and online services](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/need-support\\\") that can provide in-depth help and support for people using cannabis. They can also help and support people who are affected by someone else’s cannabis use.\n\nIf you want further information or advice then you can visit the [cannabis page](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cannabis\\\") or talk in confidence to FRANK on  0300 123 6600.\n\n_FRANK News Published: 14th October 2013_"

          "en-US": "**4th October 2013: FRANK explores the risks of mixing drugs and alcohol**\n\nThe dangers of mixing have been highlighted in the media recently but what are the facts? The truth is that by mixing drugs, including [alcohol](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/alcohol\\\"), you increase the chances of having a bad time for a range of reasons:\n\n*   Taking similar types of drugs can increase their negative effects.\n*   A drug may impair you in a particular way that makes other drug(s) you take more dangerous than usual.\n*   The drugs might interact in completely unexpected ways.\n\n**Mixing heroin and alcohol**  \n[Heroin](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/heroin\\\") and [alcohol](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/alcohol\\\") are both depressants which may make you feel relaxed but can slow down your heart rate and breathing which can be fatal. Overdose is much more likely when these drugs are taking together.\n\n**Mixing cocaine and alcohol**  \nThis combination can produce a poisonous substance in the body that may affect your heart and that stays in your system longer than [cocaine](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cocaine\\\") alone. Mixing cocaine with [alcohol](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/alcohol\\\") can hide some of the other effects of the drug which makes it easier to overdose as users take more to achieve the same high.\n\n**Mixing a stimulant (such as speed) and alcohol**  \nStimulants like [speed](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/speed\\\") are substances which make you feel more energetic. Both stimulants and [alcohol](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/alcohol\\\") put pressure on the heart, particularly with heavy use. Mixing speed with alcohol can therefore increase the risk of heart failure.\n\nIf you want to talk to FRANK in confidence then you can call the helpline 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on 0300 123 6600 or you can [chat online](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/contact-frank\\\") between 2-6pm every day.\n\n_FRANK News Published: 4th October 2013_"

Been working hard in your summer job? Bored of babysitting for your younger brother? Whatever the reason, you may be thinking of letting your hair down and escaping Britain for some summer fun. FRANK loves a holiday so has put together a few tips to make sure you have the best time possible.\n\n**Home and away**  \nIt’s easy to get carried away on holiday but remember that there is a dark side to drugs no matter where you are. If something does go wrong you’re a long way from home and different countries have different laws and penalties.\n\nIt's always best to know the facts, otherwise you can never be sure of what you're getting in to. The [drugs A-Z](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drugs-a-z\\\") is full of information about different drugs but if you’d prefer to talk then you can call on 0300 123 6600 at any time of day throughout the week. Remember if you’re calling from abroad you’ll need to add 44 to the phone number and drop the first 0.\n\n**Under pressure**  \nYour mates might be experimenting but you should never feel under pressure to take drugs – being true to yourself is the most important thing. You might be surprised to know that most young people don’t take drugs so don’t feel that it’s something you have to experience.  \n\nTrue friends will respect your decision so just say 'no' clearly and firmly. FRANK has got lots more advice on [how to resist peer pressure](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/are-you-under-the-influence\\\")_._\n\n**Look out for each other**  \nAlways keep your friends close. If you're in an unfamiliar environment with people you don't know you may get into bad situations more easily….especially if you can't speak the language! As long as your friends are around, they can advise you and help you. \n\nHave fun and keep safe!\n\n_FRANK News Published: 19th August 2013 _"

As are white, wash, toot, stones, snow, rocks, pebbles, freebase, crack, coke and chang. It’s enough to make our brains ache.\n\n**What’s the deal with cocaine?**  \n[Cocaine](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cocaine\\\") is a drug known as a stimulant as it temporarily speeds up the way your mind and body work, making you feel more conﬁdent and wide awake. However, some people can get arrogant and aggressive and do things they wouldn’t normally do.\n\nCocaine can be very dangerous and some users have died from overdoses. Over time, snorting cocaine will seriously damage the cartilage in your nose that separates the nostrils. Some heavy users end up with just one really big nostril and an odd looking nose.\n\nFind out more by exploring the [cocaine basement](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/cocaine-basement\\\") with FRANK. \n\n**What should I do if I’m offered cocaine?**  \nTake the time now to consider what you think about cocaine or any other drug for that matter. Knowing where you stand on drugs makes it easier to stay true to yourself.\n\nMost young people decide not to take drugs and if you’re one of them, simply say ‘no thanks’ clearly and firmly and don’t make a big deal about it. True friends will respect your decision not to take drugs.\n\nYou can find more guidance on [what to do if you’re offered drugs](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/are-you-under-the-influence\\\") on the website. Alternatively you can speak to a FRANK advisor 24 hours a day on 0300 123 6600 or between 2-6pm using our [Live Chat](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/contact-frank\\\") service on the website.\n\n_FRANK News Published: 20th February 2014._"

It’s a stimulant so its effects are similar to amphetamine ([Speed](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/speed\\\")). Stimulants speed up your mind and body.\n\nKhat can make you feel less hungry and if if it's chewed over a few hours it can make you feel really calm.\n\nHowever, it can lead to insomnia (which means you can’t go to sleep) and make you confused. It can also make you feel anxious and aggressive.\n\nKhat can make your mouth sore and might damage the teeth. There is concern in the long term it might cause mouth cancers.\n\nFor more information about Khat visit the [Khat A-Z page](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/khat\\\").\n\n_FRANK News Published: 3rd July 2013._"

FRANK is still available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to answer any questions you might have about drugs in complete confidence.\n\nHere are some of our favourite tips about what to do if you feel under the influence to try drugs:\n\n*   Work out where you stand on issues like sex, drugs and alcohol. Knowing your own mind makes it easier to stay true to yourself.\n*   Try to understand who is offering you the drugs and why – friends should understand if you say no, people you don’t know very well may expect something in return.\n*   Say no firmly but clearly and without making a big deal about it. If they try to persuade you, don’t feel like you have to change your mind.\n*   They may not show it, but your mates will respect you more if you’re assertive and clear about what you do and don’t want to do.\n\n_FRANK News.

          "en-US": "It’s that time of year where people are heading off to university for the first term. Freshers’ week is famous for being one of the biggest party times of the university term and is where many new friendships are forged.\n\nIt’s a lot of fun but it’s easy to get carried away so FRANK has put together a few simple tips to ensure Freshers’ week is a week to remember.\n\n**First impressions count**\n\n*   Remember to be yourself and you’ll find friends who respect you for who you are.\n*   Work out where you stand on issues like sex, drugs and alcohol. Knowing your own mind makes it easier to stay true to yourself.\n*   Don’t feel under pressure to take drugs if you don’t want to. Say ‘No’ firmly but clearly and without making a big deal about it. If people try to persuade you, don’t feel like you have to change your mind. True friends will accept who you are whatever your response.\n\n**Before you hit the town**\n\n*   Try to eat a decent meal before you go out – something high in carbohydrates, such as pasta or a jacket potato will keep you going for longer – and needn’t break the bank!\n*   Make sure you know how you’re getting home – check out the university night buses on offer, or save the all important “emergency tenner” to pay for a taxi should you need it.  Drugs can impair how you drive so you should never drive if you have been drinking or taking drugs, nor accept a lift from anyone who you know to have been drinking or taken drugs.\n\n**During the night**\n\n*   Be wary of taking drinks from large open containers and punch bowls and ‘mine-sweeping’ (picking up and drinking) unattended drinks – you’ve no way of knowing how strong it is, or even what it is. \n*   Be careful about mixing any drugs, including alcohol as this can substantially increase risk of side-effects.\n*   If you begin to feel drunk or strange after only a few drinks, seek help from a trusted friend or management at the club or pub – in case you are becoming ill, are at risk of an accident or of ending up with people who may not look after you.\n*   If you do take drugs, try to make sure you are with friends and tell them exactly what you have taken in case you run into difficulties, including whether you are mixing your drugs.\n*   Make sure you keep properly hydrated, particularly if you are taking dance drugs like ecstasy.  But be careful; too much water consumption can also be dangerous. You should consume no more than a pint of non-alcoholic fluid, such as water, fruit juice or an isotonic drink every hour.\n\n**Legal doesn’t mean safe**\n\n*   Be wary of so-called ‘legal highs’. For example, the legal high 2-DPMP (found in the product Ivory Wave), has recently been associated with a number of hospitalisations. Just because a substance is legal, it doesn’t mean it’s safe.\n*   Legal highs contain a range of potentially dangerous chemicals, and their makeup changes all the time - so you can never be certain what you have bought, and what the effects might be.\n\n**Remember you can talk to FRANK for free and in confidence 24 hours a day on 0300 123 6600.**"

FRANK has put together a guide to this year’s summer festivals, to ensure your experience is one to remember – for the right reasons.\n\n**Just because they’re legal doesn’t mean they’re safe**  \nBe cautious of ‘legal highs’, including the drug [2-DPMP](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/2-dpmp\\\") (found in the product Ivory Wave) or [Benzo Fury](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/6-apb#aka=Benzo+Fury\\\"), that may be available at this year’s festivals. Just because a substance is legal, it doesn’t mean it’s safe.\n\nLegal highs contain a range of potentially dangerous chemicals, and their makeup changes all the time - so you can never be certain what you have bought, and what the effects might be.\n\n**Leave the mixing to the DJ**  \nMixing more than one type of drug, including alcohol, on the same night increases your risks and makes the effects more unpredictable. Mixing alcohol and some drugs, like [GBL](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/ghb#aka=GBL\\\") (or liquid ecstasy) can cause a coma and death. There are risks whether you mix similar types (e.g. sedative/sedative or stimulant/stimulant) or different types (e.g. stimulant/depressant).\n\nBe wary of taking drinks from large open containers and punch bowls and ‘mine-sweeping’ (picking up and drinking) unattended drinks – you’ve no way of knowing how strong it is, or even what it is.\n\n**Under pressure**  \nWork out where you stand on issues like sex, drugs and alcohol. Knowing your own mind makes it easier to stay true to yourself. Don’t do anything you don’t want to do – your mates will respect you more for standing up for yourself.\n\nRemember most young people have not experimented with drugs or don’t want to experiment. You’re not alone!\n\n**Keep your friends close**  \nIt’s a good idea to stick together with your mates at festivals. If you do take something, then tell your friends what you’ve taken – if something does go wrong then you’ll need their help.\n\nIf someone starts to get stressed, take them somewhere quiet, try to calm them down and send for help if needed. \n\n**In case of emergency…**  \nIf someone collapses call an ambulance immediately, turn them onto their side to avoid choking and stay with them until the ambulance arrives.\n\nRemember, you won't get into trouble with the authorities for having taken drugs – paramedics don't call the police unless there has been a fatality.\n\nFRANK is available on most smartphones and you might find it helpful to link to the section on what to do [if someone has a bad time](\\\"http://www.talktofrank.com/emergency-help\\\"), including collapsing and putting someone into the recovery position.\n\nUpdated: 21st June 2012"

They can kill the first time they are used.\n  \nHere’s what else they could do to you:\n\n- Inhaling glues, gases and/or aerosols can cause mood swings, aggressive behaviour, hallucinations, vomiting and blackouts.\n\n- Squirting gas products down the throat is a particularly dangerous way of taking the drug. It can make your throat swell up so you can't breathe and it can slow down your heart and can cause a heart attack.\n\n- Some users die from passing out and choking on their own vomit.\n\n- You risk suffocation if you inhale from a plastic bag over your head.\n\n- Long-term abuse can damage the muscles, liver and kidneys. While very long term use, such as  ten years or more, can cause a lasting impairment of brain function (especially affecting how the brain controls body movement).\n\n- It can be hard to get the dose right. Just enough will give the desired ‘high’ – a little too much can result in a coma or even death.\n\n- Unsteadiness, disorientation/confusion and fainting can all contribute to the risk of accidents which are implicated in a number of the deaths.\n\n- Many products are flammable and there is a risk of burns and explosions, especially if someone is smoking nearby or if in an enclosed space.\n"

          "en-US": "#### How can I tell if a friend/child is using volatile substances?\n\nThe common signs of using volatile substances are mainly non-specific and could have other common causes. However, they can include:\n\n- dizziness\n- slurred speech\n- loss of coordination\n- talking as if hallucinating\n- paranoia and anxiety\n- a chemical smell\n- changes in appetite\n- persistently runny nose or eye irritations\n- complaining of headaches\n- rashes and pimples around the nose and mouth, though these occur only with the use of specific products and may just be due to normal teenage acne\n\nIn addition, there may be:\n\nlots of used products (empty aerosol cans, tubes of glue, etc)\nteeth marks on nozzles\nwhite marks on towels\n \nThere can also be wider ranging changes in behaviour, such as:\n\n- mixing with a new group of friends who hang out in secluded places,\n- moods swings,\n- attitude or behaviour get worse,\n- altered sleep pattern and difficulty in getting out of bed,\n- secretive or evasive behaviour, and\n- problems in school, such as poor performance, absences, etc\n \n\nThese changes do not necessarily mean that someone is misusing volatile substances as a lot of the changes are also a normal part of adolescence.\n\n\n#### Where can I get further information and resources on volatile substance misuse?\n\nThe following organisations provide information and resources on volatile substances and their misuse. Please note that FRANK is not responsible for the content of the following websites:\n\nRe-Solv [http://www.re-solv.org]  is a national charity dedicated to the prevention of solvent and volatile substance misuse (VSM). They have been operating for over twenty years and are recognised nationally and internationally as a specialist source of information on VSM.\n\nSOLVE IT [http://www.solveitonline.co.uk]  is a national charity, which provides education, training, and awareness about VSM for parents, professionals, the community, and not least, for children and young people.\n\nBritish Aerosol Manufacturers' [https://www.bama.co.uk/abuse]  Association represents the aerosol industry, from suppliers of components and ingredients to fillers and marketers of aerosol products. They provide information about VSM and action that the industry is taking to help prevent VSM.\n\n\n#### What can I do if my friend/child has a bad time after misusing volatile substances?\n\nWhen someone has a bad time on drugs, you can have a short amount of time to do something to help them. If your friend/child is using glues, gases and aerosols, knowing what to do ahead of time could help them.\n\nIf your friend/child is unconscious:\n\n- don’t panic\n- immediately phone for an ambulance\n- place them in the recovery position\n- stay with them until the ambulance arrives, and tell the ambulance crew that they have misused a volatile substance, this can help make sure that your friend/child gets the right treatment straight away\n\nIf your friend/child is drowsy:\n\n- don’t panic, stay calm and try to keep them calm\n- give them as much fresh air as possible\n- place them on their side so that they don't choke if they vomit\n- don't chase, scare or over-excite them, and stay with them until the effects have worn off\n- When someone is under the influence or has recently used, it is not usually the best time to discuss their problem. Being supportive at this stage will mean they’re more likely to talk to you about it later   \n"

This means that the patient can give up heroin avoiding acute withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn treatment of addiction, methadone dose is usually aimed initially at preventing the withdrawal symptoms that would otherwise develop when street heroin is stopped. The methadone dose can subsequently be reduced by agreement with the patient until the user is off the drug completely.\n \nThis allows people time to tackle their psychological addiction and to stabilise their lifestyle.

This allows you to compare how strong one type of alcoholic drink is to another type. For example:\n\n• half a pint of lower-strength beer, lager or cider (ABV 3.6%), or a 25ml measure of spirits (ABV 40%) is 1 unit,\n• one pint of stronger beer (ABV 5%) can be almost 3 units, and\n• one large glass (250mls) of mid-strength wine (ABV 12-13%) can be over three units.\n\n\nCheck the label on drinks as they often show the number of alcohol units.

Sometimes people turn into a nasty drunk or it affects them in other ways they don’t like. \n \n- Alcohol can make you take risks that you normally wouldn’t take when you’re sober, such as unprotected sex.\n \n- Drinking too much alcohol can leave you at risk of being taken advantage off or of being hurt by others.\n\n- Far too much alcohol on a single occasion can lead to alcohol poisoning which could put you in a coma or even kill you.\n\n- The overall health risks are broadly similar for men and women – on average, short term risks are greater for men and long term risks are greater for women.\n \n- There are short-term risks like injuries and accidents which can happen when you are drinking heavily. These can include head injuries, fractures and scars, and can sometimes be fatal. There are other short-term risks such as alcohol poisoning.\n\n- Long-term risks come from regularly drinking alcohol over a long time (over 10 to 20 years or more). Then the risks of getting different diseases increase and can lead to illnesses, such as cancer, stroke, heart disease, liver disease, and damage to your brain and nervous system.\n\n- Long-term effects include damage to the brain, body and its organs. This can take years to develop and can lead to a wide range of serious health problems, like cancers, that you may not realise are due to alcohol.\n\n- Other chemical forms of alcohol, such as methanol and butanol, are much more toxic than ethanol and should not be consumed by humans. \n"

          "en-US": "1. You may have realised that you aren’t in full control of your drug use and that it’s causing problems. The problems could be a lack of money, strained friendships, broken relationships, losing a job, or getting arrested.  And If you are getting a problem with prescribed or over-the-counter medicines, you may find you have been increasingly hiding the amount you are taking.\n2. There are two main ways you can choose to get in to treatment – self-referral or through your GP:\n\n\n- Self-referral – when you go straight to the treatment service to get help. Details of treatment services are available online, from your local NHS services, the phone book, etc. If you want details of treatment services, FRANK also has a directory of  or you can call the FRANK helpline and talk confidentially to one of our advisors.\n- Through your GP – your GP makes a referral for you to a treatment service.\n\n\n1. Before treatment can start, you will discuss your drug use with a doctor, other health professional or a trained substance misuse worker. They will let you know what treatment options are available for your drug use and any other health problems you may have. Your personal care plan will then be developed with you. This care plan normally details your immediate and longer-term treatment goals and is intended to be updated throughout your time in treatment as your needs and circumstances change.\n2. Your treatment journey should be tailored to your circumstances and needs but most treatment does involve some form of talking therapy. Prescribed medication is also needed for certain drug problems.\n\n\n- Talking therapies are when you talk about your drug problems. This may involve exploring the reasons for your drug use but may focus on what you can do to resist taking drugs or to achieve other positive goals, or may involve a mixture of these. Motivational treatment approaches and cognitive behavioural therapy are well-known therapies, but there are other forms of therapy that are used for drug problems. Depending on the circumstances, in addition to being offered a form of individual therapy, you might be offered group therapy or a period of therapeutic work with your partner or with your family. For many problem drugs, talking therapy provided alongside your care plan and other support work is the mainstay of treatment. For example, for cocaine dependence, a talking therapy alongside other support that addresses wider problems is what is most effective.Substitute prescribing refers to prescribing a safer alternative to the problem or drug, e.g. methadone mixture instead of street heroin. Using a prescribed substitute is usually only available for problems with opiates (like heroin), and as just one of the stages of treatment. \n- Substitution treatment is also used in some carefully selected individuals with problems with tranquillisers (like diazepam or Valium). Prescribed methadone is probably the best known alternative to street heroin but buprenorphine is a substitute opiate that is also used. The initial aim is to replace the very dangerous street drug with a much safer prescribed opiate. The longer-term goals of substitute prescribing are much wider and include first stabilising you on a dose of medication that avoids you experiencing any withdrawals, and on a dose that helps you to stop using your problem drug; and then using the initial period of stability to help you take the next steps to full recovery. There is very good evidence to support the use of opiate substitution treatment as one part of a path to recovery. The aim is usually then for the dosage of the substitute drug to be decreased, alongside talking treatments and other support for recovery – when agreed as part of the overall care plan."

          "en-US": "Recovery from a drug problem often involves a long-term lifestyle change, and a number of social factors can help you not to use drugs (called abstinence) and can help you to achieve an improved quality of life. These include having stable accommodation, developing a new network of non-drug using friends, re-engaging in education or work, and support from others who have had the similar problems. \n\nMutual aid groups, such as [Narcotics Anonymous](http://www.ukna.org/) or [Cocaine Anonymous](http://www.cauk.org.uk/index.asp), can play an important role in this for many people; and new forms of peer support (e.g. Smart Recovery groups) have been developing recently in the UK.\n\nIntensive rehabilitation is when you attend a special centre where you receive your treatment daily in a structured and more intensive way. This may be provided on a day-patient basis in your local area but this is also available, when it is considered appropriate for your needs, as residential rehabilitation. This involves living away from your usual circumstances and influences, usually to focus on acheiving and sustaining long-term abstinence and recovery goals.\n\nFor more information on drug treatment visit the [National Treatment Agency](http://www.nta.nhs.uk/) website. To find details of drug treatment and counselling services near you, use our [services directory](https://www.talktofrank.com/need-support). Organisations such as the addiction charity [Addaction](http://www.addaction.org.uk/) and the [Community for Recovery](http://www.addaction.org.uk/) (who specialise in glues, gases and aerosols) can also help you identify support and help available in your area."

Having a better idea of why your child takes drugs will help you when you talk to them. \n\n### To have fun\nSome young people take drugs occasionally to have fun, socialise and relax. For these people, taking drugs might not become a problem, and they’ll probably stop before any serious harm occurs. You can still explain that some drugs are illegal and can affect their physical and mental health - especially if they’re still growing - and that while you may not approve, they can always talk to you about any worries they have.  \n### To experiment\nSome people are just curious. They might try drugs once or twice to see what it’s like and then decide to leave it. Most people who do try drugs don’t continue using them.\n\n### To ‘escape’\nSome people use drugs as a way of escaping their feelings. They might be stressed, depressed, anxious or insecure, and they might think the drugs are helping them -  when they’re actually making things worse. If you think this is the case, talk calmly to your child and look for ways to work through these problems together, so you can help them manage without drugs. If necessary, look for professional help. \n\n### To fit in\nSome people take drugs to ‘fit in’, and because they’re under pressure to do so by their friends."

It all depends on who’s taking them, the person’s state of mind, what the drug is mixed with and where it’s being taken.\n\n### Physical health effects \nTaking drugs can lead to users getting more spots, colds and feeling run down generally. In the long-term, it can can lead to organ damage and other health problems.  \n\n### Mental health effects\nDrug use has been linked to depression and mood swings, as well as more serious mental health illnesses. Anybody with a history of mental health issues in their family should be especially careful when taking drugs. \n\n### Overdose \nAnyone can overdose from taking drugs. Even fit young people have died from a heart attack, especially after taking volatile substances like gases, glues and aerosols.\n\n### School or uni work \nBecause drugs like cannabis impact the part of the brain we use for learning and remembering things, regular use by young people (whose brains are still developing) can contribute to poor exam results.\n\n### Acting out of character & personal safety\nSome people take drugs because it makes them less inhibited - but this can have negative effects too. They might do things they wouldn’t normally do that they later regret, like having unprotected sex. If your child is out of it or having a bad experience on drugs, they’re more vulnerable.\n\n### A criminal record \nIf the police find your child in possession of illegal drugs they could take some action - either as a warning, an arrest, a formal caution or a conviction. \n\n### Getting into debt \nSome drugs aren’t necessarily expensive, but frequent use can still get people into debt and financial trouble.\n\nIf you’re worried about the effects of a specific drug, take a look at the drugs A-Z."

          "en-US": "It might not always seem like it, but your influence does make a difference - and you are the right person to talk to your child about drugs.\n\nResearch shows that when young people do develop a problem with drugs, family support can make a big difference to helping them get back on track.\n\nTry to keep the conversation around drugs open at all times. There’s often stories about drugs in the media and on TV, so use these as springboards for conversations. This way, when you do ask your child about drugs, it should feel more natural - and they won’t feel accused.\n\nRemember there’s no point in being heavy-handed when you talk about drugs, as this will probably backfire. Instead, take a balanced approach and bear in mind that information is everything. Giving your child the facts from reliable sources and telling them in a reasonable manner about the effects and risks, will make them feel empowered and informed rather than chastised. \n\nBe sure to talk about specific drugs too, don’t lump them all together. Make the necessary distinctions between, say, cannabis and heroin, and discuss the relative levels of harm. If they see that you have a realistic view of the risks, they’ll be more likely to listen to you."

They might try drugs once or twice to see what it’s like and then decide to leave it. Most people who do try drugs don’t continue using them.\n\n### To ‘escape’\nSome people use drugs as a way of escaping their feelings. They might be stressed, depressed, anxious or insecure, and they might think the drugs are helping them -  when they’re actually making things worse. If you think this is the case, talk calmly to your child and look for ways to work through these problems together, so you can help them manage without drugs.

Most people who try drugs don’t keep on using - and some people take drugs regularly without developing a problem.\n\nIt all depends on who’s taking them, the person’s state of mind, what the drug is mixed with and where it’s being taken.\n\n### Physical health effects\nTaking drugs can lead to users getting more spots, colds and feeling run down generally. In the long-term, it can can lead to organ damage and other health problems.\n\n### Mental health effects\nDrug use has been linked to depression and mood swings, as well as more serious mental health illnesses. Anybody with a history of mental health issues in their family should be especially careful when taking drugs.\n\n### Overdose\nAnyone can overdose from taking drugs. Even fit young people have died from a heart attack, especially after taking volatile substances like gases, glues and aerosols.\n\n### School or uni work\nBecause drugs like cannabis impact the part of the brain we use for learning and remembering things, regular use by young people (whose brains are still developing) can contribute to poor exam results.\n\n### Acting out of character & personal safety\nSome people take drugs because it makes them less inhibited - but this can have negative effects too. They might do things they wouldn’t normally do that they later regret, like having unprotected sex. If your child is out of it or having a bad experience on drugs, they’re more vulnerable.\n\n### A criminal record\nIf the police find your child in possession of illegal drugs they could take some action - either as a warning, an arrest, a formal caution or a conviction.\n\n### Getting into debt\nSome drugs aren’t necessarily expensive, but frequent use can still get people into debt and financial trouble.\n\nIf you’re worried about the effects of a specific drug, take a look at the drugs A-Z."

How, if they’re not careful, they could harm themselves, become addicted or get a criminal record.\n\nWhatever happens, make sure your friend knows you’re around, available to talk and that you’re there to help them - and not pass judgement.  \n\nAlso remember that it’s not your responsibility to help your friend.
